In the first program it doesn't encounter a new line after "Hello" so it stays in the buffer when the fork() is called.
Thus "Hello" is printed from the buffer when printf("\n") is called
In the second program it encounters a new line in "Hello\n" so it is removed from the buffer before the fork() is called.
